                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right
                mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring
                are are absolutely amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="places__paragraph">
                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
                you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and
                prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
                of the right one.

                The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                summer months.

              <p class="places__paragraph">
                A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient
                is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame
                is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town.
                It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever
                to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.
                The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios,
                and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating
                "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                wooden spoon.

                However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition â€” every
                student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
                era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its
                cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World
                Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi,
                between the country's political and economic capitals

                The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you
                would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above
                sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the
                bulk of Burundi's exports.

                The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves
                for apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This
                National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the
                Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of
                altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source
                for the various rivers and streams which provide water around
                the country.
